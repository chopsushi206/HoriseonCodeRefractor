# HoriseonCodeRefractor



## Objectives

The project was to to take an existing repositorty refractor the code, as well as use semantic HTML tags while considering accessibility. 



## Development

Began by removing unsemantic tags from index.html file and replacing with semantic tags.
These tags included: **Header, Nav, Figure, Main, Section, Article, Aside, and Footer.**

Repaired ID elements to ensure all links were functioning.

Removed the majority of class selectors and reworked CSS to define the semantic tags instead.

Added Role and Alt attribute to IMG tags; because the images did not directly correspond with the content of the page the Role was defined as presentation and Alt was left blank for accessibility purposes, as to not interfer with content.

Added a flex box to CSS for layout purposes.

Consolidated some of the CSS and reordered it to follow a more logical and semantic order.

Added Comments to CSS file.

Below are examples of parts of the index.html file before and after refractor:
